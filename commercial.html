                    <h2>Types of Commercial Properties</h2>
                    <p>Commercial properties are a broad category of real estate assets that are necessary to sustain different types of economic activity. Office buildings provide workspace for businesses in a variety of industries, acting as the foundation of corporate operations.</p>
                    <p>Office buildings provide a variety of solutions catered to various company demands, from modern coworking spaces that stimulate cooperation to imposing towers in bustling city centres. These locations, furnished with conference rooms, fast internet, and on-site facilities management, encourage creativity and productivity in today's workforce.</p>
                    <p>Their advantageous sites, which are frequently found in business parks or commercial areas, also guarantee accessibility and exposure for tenants, adding to their allure as premier company addresses. Warehouses are essential to supply chain management and logistics because they are centres for inventory control, distribution, and storage.</p>
                    <p>These large buildings are available in a variety of layouts, ranging from conventional industrial warehouses to cutting-edge fulfilment centres with robots and automation. Warehouses help sectors including manufacturing, retail, and e-commerce by facilitating the efficient flow of products and are often situated in industrial zones or important traffic corridors.</p> 
                    <p>Warehouses provide scalability and flexibility to firms looking to optimise their supply chain operations in response to shifting market needs because of features like loading docks, high ceilings, and sophisticated security systems.</p>
